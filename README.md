It then displays the outcome of those die casts on a histogram chart.
This chart intervals can be updated in one of three ways:
- Continous 
- per-Roll
- per-Second 

The app also has an option for a new winform to open and give the user the ability to instead roll 2 die at one time for a two die sum.
